## Project sinkhole

This is an unstable, experimental attempt at a small operating system.
Currently at the [Meaty Skeleton](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton) stage.
A huge thank you to the folks at osdev forums, wiki and discord.

### Differentials from Meaty Skeleton
- Using C++ instead of C for
  1. Kernel
  2. Rudimentary VGA Driver
- Alternative vga terminal scrolling
- Use my own previously implemented libc rather than wiki provided
